<p> “I want to do something of my own ...”. Does this sound familiar to you? </p>
<p> Well, most of the Indian women, particularly home makers, would resonate with this statement. </p>
<p> We all have this deep desire to do something of our own, either for money or just to prove ourselves
    to all those who have underestimated our skills from time to time. There could be other reasons too,
    but whatever be the reason, most of the times this desire of ours finds an untimely grave under the 
    heap of responsibilities. We tend to become comfortable in our cocoon and then one fine day reality 
    bites hard, when we find ourselves grappling with mid-life crisis and empty nest syndrome. </p>
    
<p> Here, we need to understand that middle age is the best time for women to show a green signal
    to their desire of being an entrepreneur. The plus points for the women in this age group are:
<ul>
    <li> Ample time </li>
    <li> Youthful energy and enthusiasm </li> 
    <li> Experience and maturity. </li>
</ul> </p>

<p> This very well explains “Thoda hai..”.  Now, lets work upon what more is needed:- <br>
<ol>
<li> <u style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 25;"> Identify your passion </u>: Is it cooking, fashion designing, interior designing, social work, finance,
     share market, training, counselling or is it anything else. The fields are diverse and many. Choose
     your passion wisely, firstly for the sake of your interest and then later for money. </li>

<li> <u style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 25;"> Convert your passion into a business idea </u>: Give it a serious thought. Shape it into a business model
     as per your convenience and comfort. For eg. would you like to do it online or will it be comfortable 
     for you to be on field for the job. Take the help of experts to give a concrete shape to your idea. </li>

<li> <u style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 25;"> Upgrade your skills </u>: Constantly evolving world warrants us to upgrade our skills in our chosen field
     of work. Do not shy off from learning new skills. Remember there is no age limit to learn a new skill.
     After all age is just a number. </li>
     
<li> <u style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 25;"> Take that first step with confidence </u>: Take that first step with confidence – You might stagger, you might
     fall, but your confidence should never waver. Learn from your mistakes, improve upon yourself and then just go ahead again. Surround yourself with people who
     encourage you. </li>
</ol>
</p>
<p> And that’s all it takes to be a woman entrepreneur. “Thoda to hai hi, bus thode ki hi zaroorat hai...”
